<body>
Ejecutar todas las celdas inferiores
</body>
</html>
```

**Alternative (also common and accurate):**

```html
<body>
Ejecutar todas las celdas de abajo
</body>
</html>
```

**Alternative (meaning subsequent/following, often used for this):**

```html
<body>
Ejecutar todas las celdas posteriores
</body>
</html>
```

All three options accurately convey the meaning in a software development context, using standard terminology ("Ejecutar" for run, "celdas" for cells). The first option ("inferiores") is a direct translation of "lower/below". The second ("de abajo") is a very common way to say "below". The third ("posteriores") means "subsequent" and is frequently used in IDEs for this exact action. I've provided the first one as the primary answer due to its directness corresponding to the source text, while keeping the HTML format as requested.
