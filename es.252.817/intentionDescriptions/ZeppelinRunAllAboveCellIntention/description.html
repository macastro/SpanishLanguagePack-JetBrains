Okay, here is the Spanish translation, avoiding duplication and preserving the HTML format, suitable for a software development context:

```html
<html>
<body>
Ejecutar todas las celdas anteriores
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

*   **Ejecutar:** Standard Spanish verb for "Run" or "Execute" in computing.
*   **todas las:** "all the" (feminine plural, agreeing with "celdas").
*   **celdas:** Standard Spanish term for "cells" in notebooks (like Jupyter) or spreadsheets.
*   **anteriores:** Means "previous" or "preceding". In the context of a top-to-bottom notebook, this accurately conveys the meaning of "above" in the execution sequence. It's often preferred over `superiores` (literally "upper") in this specific command context.
